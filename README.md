# Fraud Detection Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions using historical transaction data. We leverage XGBoost, an efficient gradient boosting algorithm, to build a robust fraud detection system.

## Features

- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Detect fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones in real-time.
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Utilizes XGBoost for accurate and efficient predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes sophisticated feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation using various metrics to ensure reliability.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and data handling.
- **Scikit-learn**: Data splitting, scaling, and evaluation.
- **XGBoost**: Core library for building the machine learning model.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization of data and feature importance.
